        description: "Developed a robust Tamil Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to address the challenges of handwritten Tamil character recognition. This system leverages deep learning techniques to accurately recognize and digitize handwritten Tamil script, preserving documents of cultural and historical significance. My approach, detailed in my research paper, involves training a CNN model on the Isolated Handwritten Tamil Character dataset by HP Labs India, which includes 156 distinct Tamil characters. This innovative solution demonstrates high accuracy in recognizing diverse handwriting styles and complex character structures, contributing significantly to the advancement of HTCR technology.",

        description: "Our project addresses the scarcity of resources and forums that adequately teach IPR to school students. To bridge this gap, we developed an interactive mobile application that enhances students’ proficiency in IPR. The app includes features such as community of legal experts, progress tracking, case studies, video tutorials, chatbot assistance for IPR, interactive quizzes, and a user-friendly interface. The core computational work involves natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to provide personalized chatbot assistance. We utilized algorithms such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for their superior capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. These models enable the chatbot to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses to student inquiries about IPR.",
